# pyepi

The tool is developed for the simulation of seasonal flu forecasting using SIR modeling with the state filters. 

Note that the main purpose of the code was only for running simulations, and the structure design is far away from 'great'. Any bugs can be reported by opening issues on github or by email.

## Dependencies
To run the simulation, one has to make sure the following packages are installed.
* numpy
* scipy

The two packages are fundamental in python. However, if you missed them before, please checkout the following sites:
* http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.10.1/user/install.html
* https://www.scipy.org/install.html
