# pyepi

The tool is developed for the simulation of seasonal flu forecasting using SIR modeling with the state filters. 

Unfortunately, the main purpose of the code was only for running simulations, and the structure design is far away from 'great'. Any bugs can be reported by opening issues on github or by email.

## Dependencies
The code now is updated to be runable in Python3. 

To run the simulation, one has to make sure the following packages are installed.
Use the following command under the directory *pyepi*:
``` 
python3 -m simulations.sim 
```
